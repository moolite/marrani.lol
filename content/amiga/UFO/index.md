# They have come, and they are not friendly

One of the best retrogames (probably ever) is UFO: Enemy Unknown, a.k.a. XCOM / Ufo Defense. I have been (re)playing it a lot over the years but i always used the MS-DOS version (we at marrani are multiplatform retrogamers, all your pixels belong to us!). This time i decided to try the Amiga - AGA version which i knew to be slower compared to the MSDOS version (with emulators or later CPUs its speed can be set how much you want) since it's in 256 colors and the AGA chipset is not known for speed.
