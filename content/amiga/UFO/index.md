# They have come, and they are not friendly

One of the best retrogames ever made is UFO: Enemy Unknown, a.k.a. XCOM / Ufo Defense. I have been (re)playing it a lot over the years but i always used the MS-DOS version (while our l0ve for Amiga is the strongest we at marrani are multiplatform retrogamers. Resistence is futile! All your pixels belong to us!). This time i decided to try the Amiga/AGA version which i knew to be slower compared to the MSDOS version since it's in 256 colors and the AGA chipset is not really known for speed, especially with an os friendly game (banging the chipset is faster, mkay?).

This version has some shortcomings:

- No night in land combat, makes the game quite easier. Im not sure why they didn't include it. Space ? Too many floppies ? (its not like they darkened every tile at runtime at will, so they probably would need to include all them tiles)

- No music in land combat, why? Same problem ? 

- No faster walking settings in land combat, whyyyyyyy ? Because of AGA slowness? I have yet to try it on a real Amiga but i think with some fast ram it should not be a problem at all

- Some bugs. No crashes - yet - though. While MSDOS version has crashed to me, even producing non playable "it will always crash at event x" saves

aaand some nices:

- Different but beautiful world view stage music

- Yes, os friendly games are slower.. buuuut it's nice to have it running in its own swappable/draggable screen. It's a multitasking OS, 'kay?

Other than that the game is exactly the same (it does even split the land combat in another executable like msdos version) and it's much fun. Been playing it on FS-UAE with a speedy 68040 non JIT configuration (no JIT yet for ARM64) with my supa AmigaOS 3.2.1 16GiB RDB hard disk image.

Unfortunately the installation script for Amiga Installer doesn't work on never AmigaOS versions but you can let the game work nicely by coping all floppies in a directory (copy all from shell) and then creating an icon for UFO_HD script and finally by assigning IconX as default tool, like 'dat:
